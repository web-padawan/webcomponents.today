Web Components are now widely supported and adopted by all modern browsers. First introduced in 2011,
they had to undergo a long journey of trial and error, reaching consensus and standardization.
Today, it's pretty clear that Web Components are here to stay. Explore this website to learn more:

- **Fundamentals** are the first thing to check if you are completely new to Web Components. Start
with [Basics](/basics/) for an overview of what these standards are all about, and then proceed to
the [Beginner's Guide](/beginners-guide/) or [Codelabs](/codelabs/) to learn how to create Custom
Elements with plain JS.
- **Standards** cover individual parts of the Web Components umbrella term. In practice, they are split
across several web standards, like HTML, DOM, and CSSOM. Also, this section lists new [proposals](/proposals/),
experimental browser features and [polyfills](/polyfills/) adding partial support for them.
- **Ecosystem** is a collection of open source projects built by awesome folks and companies out there,
including quite a few early adopters. This section includes [libraries and tools](/libraries-and-tools/),
some great examples of [design systems](/design-systems/) and [component libraries](/component-libraries/),
and a lot more.
- **Articles** cover a range of topics, like the [history](/history/) of Web Components, or existing
[styling options](/styling-options/). Developers using React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte could benefit
from [frameworks recipes](/frameworks-recipes/). Exploring [case studies](/case-studies/) might be a
good idea before starting a new project.
- **Community** is the smallest section, yet it's definitely special. Looking for a grain of salt?
You might like [opinions and takes](/opinions-and-takes/), including criticism of Web Components. The
[showcase](/showcase/) is all about sharing experience. Finally, there is a list of [who to follow](/who-to-follow/)
on Mastodon.
